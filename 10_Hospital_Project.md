🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Data Analysis – Key Insights! 📊
I recently worked on analyzing Hospital Emergency Room Data, and it was a great learning experience! This dashboard provides critical insights into patient trends, admission rates, and overall ER efficiency. Here’s what I discovered:

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/RobinKamboj001/Excel-Project-Hub/blob/main/10_Hospetal_Project.xlsx">Dataset</a>

🔹 Patient Admission Status – Out of 9,216 patients, 49.96% (4,604) were admitted, while 50.04% (4,612) were not. Understanding this helps in resource planning.

🔹 Patient Age Distribution – The 20-29 age group had the highest ER visits (1,207 patients), followed by 30-39 (1,191 patients). This insight can help optimize care for younger adults.

🔹 Timeliness in Treatment – 59.32% of patients were attended to on time, while 40.68% faced delays. Reducing this delay can significantly improve patient experience.

🔹 Gender Analysis – The distribution is almost equal, with 51.05% female and 48.95% male patients. This insight helps in designing gender-specific healthcare initiatives.

🔹 Department Referrals – Most patients were referred to General Practice (1,840 patients), followed by Orthopedics (995 patients). Understanding these patterns can improve specialist availability in high-demand areas.

🔍 Key Takeaway – Data-driven insights like these can help hospitals improve efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation in emergency care.

📢 Would love to hear your thoughts! How can hospitals further optimize ER management using data?
